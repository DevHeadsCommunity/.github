# Code of Conduct
Participating in open source is as much a social practice as it is technical. Communities include people from many different 
backgrounds. This section provides guidance on participation in the DevHeads open source community; it outlines the process of 
reporting unacceptable behavior, and documents consequences for such behavior.

### Our Pledge
DevHeads is committed to providing an inclusive environment for everyone; regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual 
orientation, disabilities, neurodiversity, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, age, religion or similar 
personal characteristics.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

### Our Standards
Contributors, members, or bystanders we each individually have responsibility to act professionally and respectfully at all times. 

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:
- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

### Our Responsibility
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate 
and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and 
other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other 
behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community
in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official email address, posting via an official social 
media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

This Code of Conduct also applies outside the project spaces when the Project Stewards have a reasonable belief that an individual’s 
behavior may have a negative impact on the project or its community.

## Enforcement Guideline
Project maintainers will follow these Enforcement Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of 
this Code of Conduct:
1. **Correction**

    - **Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.
    - **Consequence**: A private, written warning, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the 
 behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

2. **Warning**

    - **Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.
    - **Consequence**: A written warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including 
    unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions 
    in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

3. **Temporary Ban**

    - **Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.
    - **Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. 
    No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, 
    is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

4. **Permanent Ban**

    - **Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment 
    of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.
    - **Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Reporting Code of Conduct Issues:
Reporting should be directed to the DevHeads Community Leaders at [](email@devheads.io). It is the community leaders’ duty to receive 
and address reported violations of the code of conduct. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. 
Any member, contributor, or bystander of the community may report a Code of Conduct issue, even if they were not the target of 
unacceptable behavior or harassment. Reports will be kept private and secure.
